# Degrees of Bizarre Lewdity
Backup of the Degrees of Lewdity Jojo Mod. This is unofficial and the purpose of it is to keep this DoL history alive.


# FAQ

# How do I play this?
You download the repository (either through commandline git clone, or by pressing "Code" and then "Download"), then install it like you would any other mod (Note: The "Wiki" folder is optional and only there in case the official Wiki gets shut down; the official Wiki already got vandalized, so you are recommended to use the archive if needed).

# Why was the mod taken down originally?
The original developer abandoned the project. Later, someone who couldn't be identified but claimed to be the creator demanded DoLMods take it down.

# Why did the original creator demand it be taken down?
(Note, this specific section is unverifyable hearsay, take it with a grain of salt.)
Allegedly, the creator worked with someone on the mod who later turned out to be a minor. Because the creator couldn't handle this even months after, he demanded it be removed from his own Discord Server (which he did not own) and DoLMods.

# Will there be updates? The Wiki included says so.
The Wiki included is an archive, thus information about future updates are incorrect. You are free to pull the mod and work on it yourself to your hearts content.

# I have encountered a bug, where do I report it?
Nowhere, there will be no updates except additional archives. I don't know how to work on this mod, else I would've continued it.

# I want this taken down, what do I do to contact you?
Send me a Direct Message (or preferably an E-Mail), prove that you are the creator, and that you hold copyright, then we can gladly talk about it.
